In case, there is no need for several adapters in your project, you can use composer to ensure these adapters are not being installed.

Serialization PSR-16 has strict requirements around serialization of values. This is done to ensure that if you swap one PSR-16 adapter for another, the new one will be able to return the same values that the original adapter saved to the cache. Not all cache backends support the same data types, however. laminas-cache provides a plugin, Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Plugin\\Serializer , that you can attach to adapters in order to ensure data is serialized to a string when saving to the cache, and deserialized to native PHP types on retrieval. The following adapters require this plugin in order to work with the SimpleCacheDecorator : Dba Filesystem Memcache MongoDB Redis XCache We provide a number of examples of attaching plugins to storage adapters in the plugins chapter . Generally, it will be one of: use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface; use Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Plugin\\Serializer; use Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface; // Manual attachment after you have an instance: $cache-&gt;addPlugin(new Serializer()); // Via configuration: /** @var ContainerInterface $container */ $container = null; // can be any configured PSR-11 container $storageFactory = $container-&gt;get(StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::class); $cache = $storageFactory-&gt;create( 'filesystem', [], [ ['name' =&gt; 'serializer'], ] ); Deleting Items and Exceptions PSR-16 states that the delete() and deleteMultiple() methods should return false if an error occured when deleting the key(s) provided, but true otherwise. Generally, laminas-cache storage adapters comply with this. However, it is possible to configure your adapter such that you may get a false positive result from these methods. When an exception is raised and caught during key removal by an adapter, the adapter triggers an event with a Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\ExceptionEvent . Plugins can react to these, and even manipulate the event instance. One such plugin, Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Plugin\\ExceptionHandler , has a configuration option, throw_exceptions that, when boolean false , will prevent raising the exception. In such cases, adapters will typically return a boolean false anyways, but custom, third-party adapters may not. Additionally, if you add a custom plugin that listens to removal event exceptions and modifies the return value and/or disables throwing the exception, a false positive return value could occur. As such, we recommend that if you wish to use laminas-cache to provide a PSR-16 adapter, you audit the plugins you use with your adapter to ensure that you will get consistent, correct behavior for delete() and deleteMultiple() operations.","title":"PSR-16"},{"location":"v2/psr16/#psr-16","text":"Available since version 2.8.0 PSR-16 provides a simplified approach to cache access that does not involve cache pools, tags, deferment, etc.; it can be thought of as a key/value storage approach to caching. laminas-cache provides PSR-16 support via the class Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\SimpleCache\\SimpleCacheDecorator .

PSR-6 specifies a common interface to cache storage, enabling developers to switch between implementations without having to worry about any behind-the-scenes differences between them. Quick Start To use the pool, instantiate your storage as normal, then pass it to the CacheItemPoolDecorator . use Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\CacheItemPool\\CacheItemPoolDecorator;use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface;use Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface; /** @var ContainerInterface $container */ $container = null; // can be any configured PSR-11 container $storageFactory = $container-&gt;get(StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::class); $storage = $storageFactory-&gt;create('apc'); $pool = new CacheItemPoolDecorator($storage); // attempt to get an item from cache $item = $pool-&gt;getItem('foo'); // check whether item was found if (! $item-&gt;isHit()) { // ... // perform expensive operation to calculate $value for 'foo' // ... $item-&gt;set($value); $pool-&gt;save($item); } // use the value of the item echo $item-&gt;get(); Note that you will always get back a CacheItem object, whether it was found in cache or not: this is so false -y values like an empty string, null , or false can be stored. Always check isHit() to determine if the item was found. Supported Adapters The PSR-6 specification requires that the underlying storage support time-to-live (TTL), which is set when the item is saved. For this reason the following adapters cannot be used: Dba , Filesystem , Memory and Session . The XCache adapter calculates TTLs based on the request time, not the time the item is actually persisted, which means that it also cannot be used. In addition adapters must support the Laminas\\Cache\\FlushableInterface . All the current Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter s fulfil this requirement. Attempting to use an unsupported adapter will throw an exception implementing Psr\\Cache\\CacheException . The Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\CacheItemPool\\CacheItemPoolDecorator adapter doesn't support driver deferred saves, so cache items are saved on destruct or on explicit commit() call. Quirks APC You cannot set the apc.use_request_time ini setting with the APC adapter: the specification requires that all TTL values are calculated from when the item is actually saved to storage. If this is set when you instantiate the pool it will throw an exception implementing Psr\\Cache\\CacheException . Changing the setting after you have instantiated the pool will result in non-standard behaviour. Logging Errors The specification states : While caching is often an important part of application performance, it should never be a critical part of application functionality. Thus, an error in a cache system SHOULD NOT result in application failure. Once you've got your pool instance, almost all exceptions thrown by the storage will be caught and ignored. The only storage exceptions that bubble up implement Psr\\Cache\\InvalidArgumentException and are typically caused by invalid key errors. To be PSR-6 compliant, cache keys must not contain the following characters: {}()/\\@: . However different storage adapters may have further restrictions. Check the documentation for your particular adapter to be sure. We strongly recommend tracking exceptions caught from storage, either by logging them or recording them in some other way. Doing so is as simple as adding an ExceptionHandler plugin . Say you have a PSR-3 compliant logger called $logger : use Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\CacheItemPool\\CacheItemPoolDecorator; use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface; use Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface; $cacheLogger = function (\\Exception $e) use ($logger) { $message = sprintf( '[CACHE] %s:%s %s \"%s\"', $exception-&gt;getFile(), $exception-&gt;getLine(), $exception-&gt;getCode(), $exception-&gt;getMessage() ); $logger-&gt;error($message); }; /** @var ContainerInterface $container */ $container = null; // can be any configured PSR-11 container $storageFactory = $container-&gt;get(StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::class); $storage = $storageFactory-&gt;create( 'apc', [], [ [ 'name' =&gt; 'exceptionhandler', 'options' =&gt; [ 'exception_callback' =&gt; $cacheLogger, 'throw_exceptions' =&gt; true, ], ], ] ); $pool = new CacheItemPoolDecorator($storage); Note that throw_exceptions should always be true (the default) or you will not get the correct return values from calls on the pool such as save() . Supported Data Types As per the specification , the following data types can be stored in cache: string , integer , float , boolean , null , array , object and be returned as a value with exactly the same type. Not all adapters can natively store all these types. For instance, Redis stores booleans and integers as a string.

They come with tons of methods to read, write, and modify stored items, and to get information about stored items and the storage. All adapters implement Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\StorageInterface , and most extend Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\AbstractAdapter , which provides a foundation of common logic. Configuration is handled by either Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\AdapterOptions , or an adapter-specific options class if it exists. You may pass the options instance to the class at instantiation, via the setOptions() method, or, alternately, pass an associative array of options in either place (internally, these are then passed to an options class instance). Alternately, you can pass associative array to the Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::create method. Quick Start Caching adapters can either be created from the provided Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface , or by instantiating one of the Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\* classes. To make life easier, the Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface comes with a create() method to create an adapter and all requested plugins at once. use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface; use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StoragePluginFactoryInterface; use Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface; /** @var ContainerInterface $container */ $container = null; // can be any configured PSR-11 container /** @var StorageAdapterFactoryInterface $storageFactory */ $storageFactory = $container-&gt;get(StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::class); // Via factory: $cache = $storageFactory-&gt;create( 'apc', ['ttl' =&gt; 3600], [ [ 'name' =&gt; 'exception_handler', 'options' =&gt; [ 'throw_exceptions' =&gt; false, ], ], ] ); // Via array configuration: $cache = $storageFactory-&gt;createFromArrayConfiguration([ 'adapter' =&gt; 'apc', 'options' =&gt; ['ttl' =&gt; 3600], 'plugins' =&gt; [ [ 'name' =&gt; 'exception_handler', 'options' =&gt; [ 'throw_exceptions' =&gt; false, ], ], ], ]); // Alternately, create the adapter and plugin separately: $cache = $storageFactory-&gt;create('apc', ['ttl' =&gt; 3600]); $pluginFactory = $container-&gt;get(StoragePluginFactoryInterface::class); $plugin = $pluginFactory-&gt;create('exception_handler', [ 'throw_exceptions' =&gt; false, ]); $cache-&gt;addPlugin($plugin); // Or do it completely manually: $cache = new Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\Apc(); $cache-&gt;getOptions()-&gt;setTtl(3600); $plugin = new Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Plugin\\ExceptionHandler(); $plugin-&gt;getOptions()-&gt;setThrowExceptions(false); $cache-&gt;addPlugin($plugin); Many Methods throw Exceptions Because many caching operations throw an exception on error, you need to catch them.

This class implements PSR-16's Psr\\SimpleCache\\CacheInterface , and composes a Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\StorageInterface instance to which it proxies all operations. Instantiation is as follows: use Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\SimpleCache\\SimpleCacheDecorator; use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface; use Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface; /** @var ContainerInterface $container */ $container = null; // can be any configured PSR-11 container $storageFactory = $container-&gt;get(StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::class); $storage = $storageFactory-&gt;create('apc'); $cache = new SimpleCacheDecorator($storage); Once you have a SimpleCacheDecorator instance, you can perform operations per that specification: // Use has() to determine whether to fetch the value or calculate it: $value = $cache-&gt;has('someKey') ? $cache-&gt;get('someKey') : calculateValue(); if (! $cache-&gt;has('someKey')) { $cache-&gt;set('someKey', $value); } // Or use a default value: $value = $cache-&gt;get('someKey', $defaultValue); When setting values, whether single values or multiple, you can also optionally provide a Time To Live (TTL) value. This proxies to the underlying storage instance's options, temporarily resetting its TTL value for the duration of the operation. TTL values may be expressed as integers (in which case they represent seconds) or DateInterval instances. As examples: $cache-&gt;set('someKey', $value, 30); // set TTL to 30s $cache-&gt;set('someKey', $value, new DateInterval('P1D')); // set TTL to 1 day $cache-&gt;setMultiple([ 'key1' =&gt; $value1, 'key2' =&gt; $value2, ], 3600); // set TTL to 1 hour $cache-&gt;setMultiple([ 'key1' =&gt; $value1, 'key2' =&gt; $value2, ], new DateInterval('P6H')); // set TTL to 6 hours For more details on what methods are exposed, consult the CacheInterface specification . Serialization PSR-16 has strict requirements around serialization of values. This is done to ensure that if you swap one PSR-16 adapter for another, the new one will be able to return the same values that the original adapter saved to the cache. Not all cache backends support the same data types, however. laminas-cache provides a plugin, Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Plugin\\Serializer , that you can attach to adapters in order to ensure data is serialized to a string when saving to the cache, and deserialized to native PHP types on retrieval.

Generally, laminas-cache storage adapters comply with this. However, it is possible to configure your adapter such that you may get a false positive result from these methods. When an exception is raised and caught during key removal by an adapter, the adapter triggers an event with a Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\ExceptionEvent . Plugins can react to these, and even manipulate the event instance. One such plugin, Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Plugin\\ExceptionHandler , has a configuration option, throw_exceptions that, when boolean false , will prevent raising the exception. In such cases, adapters will typically return a boolean false anyways, but custom, third-party adapters may not. Additionally, if you add a custom plugin that listens to removal event exceptions and modifies the return value and/or disables throwing the exception, a false positive return value could occur. As such, we recommend that if you wish to use laminas-cache to provide a PSR-16 adapter, you audit the plugins you use with your adapter to ensure that you will get consistent, correct behavior for delete() and deleteMultiple() operations.","title":"PSR-16"},{"location":"v3/psr16/#psr-16","text":"PSR-16 provides a simplified approach to cache access that does not involve cache pools, tags, deferment, etc.; it can be thought of as a key/value storage approach to caching. laminas-cache provides PSR-16 support via the class Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\SimpleCache\\SimpleCacheDecorator .

PSR-6 specifies a common interface to cache storage, enabling developers to switch between implementations without having to worry about any behind-the-scenes differences between them. Quick Start To use the pool, instantiate your storage as normal, then pass it to the CacheItemPoolDecorator . use Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\CacheItemPool\\CacheItemPoolDecorator;use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface;use Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface; /** @var ContainerInterface $container */ $container = null; // can be any configured PSR-11 container $storageFactory = $container-&gt;get(StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::class); $storage = $storageFactory-&gt;create('apc'); $pool = new CacheItemPoolDecorator($storage); // attempt to get an item from cache $item = $pool-&gt;getItem('foo'); // check whether item was found if (! $item-&gt;isHit()) { // ... // perform expensive operation to calculate $value for 'foo' // ... $item-&gt;set($value); $pool-&gt;save($item); } // use the value of the item echo $item-&gt;get(); Note that you will always get back a CacheItem object, whether it was found in cache or not: this is so false -y values like an empty string, null , or false can be stored. Always check isHit() to determine if the item was found. Supported Adapters The PSR-6 specification requires that the underlying storage support time-to-live (TTL), which is set when the item is saved. For this reason the following adapters cannot be used: Dba , Filesystem , Memory and Session . The XCache adapter calculates TTLs based on the request time, not the time the item is actually persisted, which means that it also cannot be used. In addition adapters must support the Laminas\\Cache\\FlushableInterface . All the current Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter s fulfil this requirement. Attempting to use an unsupported adapter will throw an exception implementing Psr\\Cache\\CacheException . The Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\CacheItemPool\\CacheItemPoolDecorator adapter doesn't support driver deferred saves, so cache items are saved on destruct or on explicit commit() call. Quirks APC You cannot set the apc.use_request_time ini setting with the APC adapter: the specification requires that all TTL values are calculated from when the item is actually saved to storage. If this is set when you instantiate the pool it will throw an exception implementing Psr\\Cache\\CacheException . Changing the setting after you have instantiated the pool will result in non-standard behaviour. Logging Errors The specification states : While caching is often an important part of application performance, it should never be a critical part of application functionality. Thus, an error in a cache system SHOULD NOT result in application failure. Once you've got your pool instance, almost all exceptions thrown by the storage will be caught and ignored. The only storage exceptions that bubble up implement Psr\\Cache\\InvalidArgumentException and are typically caused by invalid key errors. To be PSR-6 compliant, cache keys must not contain the following characters: {}()/\\@: . However different storage adapters may have further restrictions. Check the documentation for your particular adapter to be sure. We strongly recommend tracking exceptions caught from storage, either by logging them or recording them in some other way. Doing so is as simple as adding an ExceptionHandler plugin . Say you have a PSR-3 compliant logger called $logger : use Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\CacheItemPool\\CacheItemPoolDecorator; use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface; use Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface; $cacheLogger = function (\\Exception $e) use ($logger) { $message = sprintf( '[CACHE] %s:%s %s \"%s\"', $exception-&gt;getFile(), $exception-&gt;getLine(), $exception-&gt;getCode(), $exception-&gt;getMessage() ); $logger-&gt;error($message); }; /** @var ContainerInterface $container */ $container = null; // can be any configured PSR-11 container $storageFactory = $container-&gt;get(StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::class); $storage = $storageFactory-&gt;create( 'apc', [], [ [ 'name' =&gt; 'exceptionhandler', 'options' =&gt; [ 'exception_callback' =&gt; $cacheLogger, 'throw_exceptions' =&gt; true, ], ], ] ); $pool = new CacheItemPoolDecorator($storage); Note that throw_exceptions should always be true (the default) or you will not get the correct return values from calls on the pool such as save() . Supported Data Types As per the specification , the following data types can be stored in cache: string , integer , float , boolean , null , array , object and be returned as a value with exactly the same type. Not all adapters can natively store all these types. For instance, Redis stores booleans and integers as a string. Where this is the case all values will be automatically run through serialize() on save and unserialize() on get: you do not need to use a Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Plugin\\Serializer plugin.","title":"PSR-6"},{"location":"v3/psr6/#psr-6","text":"","title":"PSR-6"},{"location":"v3/psr6/#overview","text":"The Laminas\\Cache\\Psr\\CacheItemPool\\CacheItemPoolDecorator provides a PSR-6 compliant wrapper for supported storage adapters.

They come with tons of methods to read, write, and modify stored items, and to get information about stored items and the storage. All adapters implement Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\StorageInterface , and most extend Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\AbstractAdapter , which provides a foundation of common logic. Configuration is handled by either Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\AdapterOptions , or an adapter-specific options class if it exists. You may pass the options instance to the class at instantiation, via the setOptions() method, or, alternately, pass an associative array of options in either place (internally, these are then passed to an options class instance). Alternately, you can pass associative array to the Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::create method. Quick Start Caching adapters can either be created from the provided Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface , or by instantiating one of the Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\* classes. To make life easier, the Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface comes with a create() method to create an adapter and all requested plugins at once. use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StorageAdapterFactoryInterface; use Laminas\\Cache\\Service\\StoragePluginFactoryInterface; use Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface; /** @var ContainerInterface $container */ $container = null; // can be any configured PSR-11 container /** @var StorageAdapterFactoryInterface $storageFactory */ $storageFactory = $container-&gt;get(StorageAdapterFactoryInterface::class); // Via factory: $cache = $storageFactory-&gt;create( 'apcu', ['ttl' =&gt; 3600], [ [ 'name' =&gt; 'exception_handler', 'options' =&gt; [ 'throw_exceptions' =&gt; false, ], ], ] ); // Via array configuration: $cache = $storageFactory-&gt;createFromArrayConfiguration([ 'adapter' =&gt; 'apcu', 'options' =&gt; ['ttl' =&gt; 3600], 'plugins' =&gt; [ [ 'name' =&gt; 'exception_handler', 'options' =&gt; [ 'throw_exceptions' =&gt; false, ], ], ], ]); // Alternately, create the adapter and plugin separately: $cache = $storageFactory-&gt;create('apcu', ['ttl' =&gt; 3600]); $pluginFactory = $container-&gt;get(StoragePluginFactoryInterface::class); $plugin = $pluginFactory-&gt;create('exception_handler', [ 'throw_exceptions' =&gt; false, ]); $cache-&gt;addPlugin($plugin); // Or do it completely manually: $cache = new Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\Apcu(); $cache-&gt;getOptions()-&gt;setTtl(3600); $plugin = new Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Plugin\\ExceptionHandler(); $plugin-&gt;getOptions()-&gt;setThrowExceptions(false); $cache-&gt;addPlugin($plugin); Many Methods throw Exceptions Because many caching operations throw an exception on error, you need to catch them.
