# laminas-cache

[![Build Status](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-cache/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-cache/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml)

`Laminas\Cache` provides a general cache system for PHP. The `Laminas\Cache` component
is able to cache different patterns (class, object, output, etc) using different
storage adapters (DB, File, Memcache, etc).


- File issues at https://github.com/laminas/laminas-cache/issues
- Documentation is at https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-cache/

## Benchmarks

We provide scripts for benchmarking laminas-cache using the
[PHPBench](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench) framework; these can be
found in the `benchmark/` directory.

To execute the benchmarks you can run the following command:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpbench run --report=aggregate
```

## Avoid Unused Cache Adapters Are Being Installed

> ### Only necessary in 2.10+
>
> Starting with 3.0.0, no storage adapter is required by this component and thus, each project has to specify the storage adapters which are required by the project.
> When migrated to 3.0.0, the `replace` section is not needed anymore.

With `laminas-cache` v2.10.0, we introduced satellite packages for all cache adapters.

In case, there is no need for several adapters in your project, you can use composer to ensure these adapters are not being installed. To make this happen, you have to specify a `replace` property within the `composer.json` of your project.

### Example `composer.json` with Only Memory Adapter Being Installed

```json
{
    "name": "vendor/project",
    "description": "",
    "type": "project",
    "require": {
        "laminas/laminas-cache": "^2.10",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-adapter-storage-memory": "^1.0"
    },
    "replace": {
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-apc": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-apcu": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-blackhole": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-dba": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-ext-mongodb": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-filesystem": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-memcache": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-memcached": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-mongodb": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-redis": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-session": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-wincache": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-xcache": "*",
        "laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-zend-server": "*"
    }
}
```

When using `composer install` on this, only the `laminas/laminas-cache-storage-adapter-memory` is being installed.
